## Delta

Independent Termux-side Phase-A implementation with:
- no includes/libc/libm/heap/syscall in the core header;
- canonical witness selftest plus exhaustive byte/q sweep;
- ARMv7 and AArch64 raw `_start` exit veneers;
- static freestanding link/audit;
- QEMU user-mode execution wired into the existing freestanding runtime gate.

## State at write

SOURCE = IMPLEMENTED
HOST_SELFTEST = NOT_RUN
ARMV7_STATIC_ELF = NOT_RUN

The implementation is a consumer/runtime reproduction, not ZIPRAF format authority.
